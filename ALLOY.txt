\subsection{Alloy Model discussion}


As part of this Requirement Analysis and Specification Document we created an alloy model to visualize the world that is generated by Travlendar. The purpose of the model was to get an overview over the structure of the application and the different layers that the user will interact with. The model is intended more as an illustration of what the application will accomplish and produce when up and running as opposed to how it will actually work on the back-end. Therefore the focus has been on the components inherent to the internal software and external interactions has been omitted in this model. Found below is the code for the model, the execution results along with an example world obtained from running it.


As we conceptualized the structure of the application the alloy model assisted us in ensuring that the logic of the relationships between our elements was intact by seeing that the world our model generated was feasible. The usage of alloy helped us to visualize the sheer numerous potential combinations of components a calendar could include, as well as how interrelated these components are vertically. For example, if a day is to populate within a calendar it has to include an event, and for an event to be successfully created it is required to be reachable by having a generated journey (composed of one or multiple paths). Therefore, for any calendar that is not empty there must be at least one instance of every type of component. Beyond this, at any level of this hierarchy of related components, multiple “children” can belong to the same “parent”.
